# blood_cells_detector-with-Python-OpenCV
_Calculate the average count and speed of blood cells in videos using cv2 and vidstab_

## 1. Preamble
**_Used python modules:_**

_We use numpy module for a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays and python-opencv module for video processing. Vidstab is used to correct undesirable shakes and jitters when we use hand-held camera and camera mounted on vehicles. tkinter module is responsible for gui part in our project and multiprocessing module can be used for multiprocessing on multi-core computers to boost the performance speed.
Furthermore, we use pyautogui module to select ROI using mouse click and math module for several mathematical operations like sqrt. matplotlib module is used to draw 2D graph for the final results and we import collections module to use python store variable types like tuple, dictionary and list.
Last, we import two customized modules, namely common and video which are responsible for clocking & selection of ROI and processing video including importing, respectively._
